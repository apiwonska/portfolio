# Portfolio

[Live demo](https://annapiwonska.eu)

A personal portfolio site built with React library to present my projects

In every project, I practice some new skills. Doing this project, I have learned more about animations, CSS modules and sass (scss syntax). It was also an opportunity to practice Typescript and testing with React Testing Library. Animations were created without any library, just using CSS and Intersection Observer.

## Built with:

- React (functional components, hooks)
- Typescript
- CSS modules
- Sass
- React Router
- React Hook Form
- React Testing Library
- Jest
- Eslint

Design and code: Anna Piwonska
